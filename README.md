# React + Eui Template for An Event Website

This is a template for an event based website. It started as a website I created for an event my ERG is hosting ([Rainbow Stack Summit](https://www.rainbowstacksummit.com/)), but I decided to make it it's own repo so others can contribute to it and use as well!

This is all very much WIP, so if you have any comments or ideas, or want to contribute, feel free to create an issue.
